% In continuous-time, a state-space model is of the following form
% x_dot = Am * x + Bm * u (state equation)
% y = Cm * x + Dm * u (output equation)

% x is the state vector

% plant with Nx states Ny outputs and Nu inputs
% A is an Nx-by-Nx
% B is an Nx-by-Nu
% C is an Ny-by-Nx
% D is an Ny-by-Nu
% C and D matrices are not used that much for right now, we are mostly
% focusing on the A and B matrices

% Sprite A and B matrices https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KB5MakLq4chCMw_LIEHwt1gUXMJI7K9Q

% Building these A and B matrices are the hardest part, the state vector is
% easy to create but the matrices are actually a challenge
